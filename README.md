# CompressedSensingJHU
Best Final Project for Compressed Sensing at JHU Spring 2018

We aim to use the techniques we learned in compressed sensing class to do sparse recovery on MRI images. 

1. Literature review (the goal is to find the best work done before) 3/10
  * find interesting projects
    - DT-MRI
    - holography
    - video recovery
    - anything that requires resolution improvements
  * some spec:
    - good accuracy
    - provide all parameters
    - provide datasets
    
2. find the following take-away from literatures 3/24
 * what are the state-of-the-art methods

3. Datasets search 4/6
 * from literaturen
 * from google  
  
4. Develop a working model  4/30
 * Preprocessing
 * Compressed sensing
  
5. Fine tune  5/7

6. Comparison 5/12
  by now, we should have an optimized working model  
 * fix training and classification methods, try different feature extraction methods
