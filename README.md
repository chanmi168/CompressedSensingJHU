# CompressedSensingJHU
Best Final Project for Compressed Sensing at JHU Spring 2018

We aim to use the techniques we learned in compressed sensing class to do sparse recovery on MRI images. 

1. Literature review (the goal is to find the best work done before)  
  * some spec:  
    - good accuracy
    - provide all parameters
    - provide datasets
    
2. find the following take-away from literatures
 * what are the state-of-the-art methods

3. Datasets search  
 * from literaturen
 * from google  
  
4. Develop a working model
 * classify and calculate accuracy  
  
5. Fine tune  

6. Comparison
  by now, we should have an optimized working model  
 * fix training and classification methods, try different feature extraction methods
